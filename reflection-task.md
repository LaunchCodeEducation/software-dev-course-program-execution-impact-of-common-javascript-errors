Take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned about the three common types
of programming errors—syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors—and their impact
on program execution. Consider the following questions to guide your reflection:


Understanding the Types of Errors:
  1. Can you clearly explain the differences between syntax, runtime, and logic errors?
  
  2. Which type of error do you think would be the easiest to detect and fix? Why?
  
  3. Which type of error do you think would be the hardest to detect? How might this impact the debugging process?


Examples and Real-World Context:
  1. Think about the examples provided in the lesson. Have you encountered similar errors in your own coding?
  How did you approach resolving them?
  
  2. Imagine a runtime error occurring in a real-world application, such as a healthcare device or an
  e-commerce website. What could the consequences be, and how would you ensure such errors are addressed effectively?


Impact Beyond the Code:
  1. How do you think errors in your code could affect users’ experiences? For instance, what would happen
  if a logic error caused a program to produce incorrect results?

  2. Consider the broader impact of errors—on system reliability, financial stability, and organizational
  reputation. How does understanding these implications change the way you approach writing and testing your code?


Your Learning and Growth:
  1. What strategies or tools have you learned that will help you prevent or fix errors in your code?

  2. How can you use errors as learning opportunities to become a more confident and capable developer?

  3. Write a short reflection addressing one or more of these questions. Share your insights with the class
  or in a small group discussion to deepen your understanding and learn from your peers.
